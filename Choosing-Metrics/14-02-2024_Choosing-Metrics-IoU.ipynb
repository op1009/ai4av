    "\n",
    "Before we begin our implementation, let's review the definition of IoU from [Rezatofighi et al., 2018](https://giou.stanford.edu/) [1] and why we choose this metric for our bounding box prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Intersection over Union (IoU), also known as [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), is the most popular evaluation metric for tasks such as segmentation, object detection and tracking. In object detection, IoU is used as a metric to evaluate how close the prediction and ground truth bounding boxes overlap._ \n",
    "\n",
    "_IoU has the appealing property of scale invariance. This means that the width, height and location of the two bounding boxes under consideration are taken into account. The normalized IoU measure focuses on the area of the shapes, no matter their size._\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, IoU is a metric that describes the amount of overlap between two bounding boxes with a normalized score ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`. The greater the overlapping region, the greater our IoU score will be. The IoU score will be an important factor in determining the \"quality\" of our bounding box predictions, as the size of the overlapping regions of interest will vary with respect to the accuracy of our predicted coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustrated in Fig. 1 is a set of possible bounding box configuratons. For our problem, we can consider one of the two boxes to be formed from the ground truth coordinates and the other to be formed from predicted coordinates. In the case of our problem, a full overlap shown in Fig. 1(d) represents a perfect prediction and is given an IoU score of `1.0`. On the other hand, zero overlap shown in Fig. 1(a) corresponds to an IoU score of `0.0` and usually indicates a complete mismatch between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.\n",

    "Let's consider the data we are given as input to our `calculate_ious` function. The first list, `gt_bboxes`, contains `(x, y)`coordinate pairs corresponding to the upper-left and lower-right coordinates of each ground truth bounding box. The second list, `pred_bboxes`, is similar to the first, but contains instead the coordinate pairs of each _predicted_ bounding box. It is then our job to figure out the overlapping region of interest between each _ground truth_ and _predicted_ bounding box, as illustrated in Fig. 5 above. To do so, we need to know which values the coordinates $(x_3, y_3)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent in our input lists. While this looks like a trivial exercise from the example above, we have to acknowledge a few important assumptions before we get into calculating the IoU forumla.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the coordinate reference system we defined above, we will be using the `max` function over the two boxes' upper-left `x`- and `y`-coordinate values, and the `min` function over the lower-right `x`- and `y`-coordinate values, as such:\n",

    "#### Considerations for our problem\n",
    "_Precision_ and _recall_ are often defined for binary classification problems involving a set of \"correct\" and \"incorrect\" class label predictions. In such problems, the true positive (_TP_) and true negative (_TN_) values are simply the number of _correct_ positive and negative class label predictions. It follows that the false positive (_FP_) and false negative (_FN_) values are the number of _incorrect_ class label predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of object recognition, we must adapt these definitions to fit the pairwise continuous IoU scores we computed earlier. In order to count the number of _correct_ and _incorrect_ bounding box predictions, we will use a _threshold value_ of $0.5$. That is, any IoU score above the threshold value of $0.5$ will be considered _correct_, and any IoU score below the threshold value will be considered _incorrect_. \n",
    "\n",
    "One other important consideration specific to the bounding box prediction task is the _elimination of the TN term_. A non-zero true negative (TN) value would indicate that our model has sometimes predicted \"no bounding box\" in an image that does in fact _not_ contain a bounding box. Since in our ground truth dataset we are assured that every sample contains a single bounding box, we know that a non-zero TN value could not be possible and that \"no bounding box\" is not a prediction our model makes. In summary, every sample in `pred_bboxes` corresponds to a predicted bounding box based on its ground truth sample which is gauranteed to contain a bounding box somewhere in the image frame.\n",
    "* **True Positives (TP)**: set of bounding box predictions an IoU score greater than the threshold value (0.5) where the ground truth and predicted class labels are the same;\n",
    "    * `the image contains a bounding box of class i and model predicts bounding box for class i with IoU > 0.5`.\n",
    "* **False Positives (FP)**: set of bounding box predictions with an IoU score greater than the threshold value (0.5) where the predicted and ground truth class labels are _NOT_ the same;\n",
    "    * `the image contains a bounding box of class i and model predicts bounding box for class j with IoU > 0.5.`\n",
    "* **True Negative (TN):** set of bounding box pairs whose ground truth and predicted bounding boxes are 'None';\n",
    "    * `not applicable in our dataset.`\n",
    "* **False Negative (FN):** set of ground truth bounding boxes where the corresponding class predictions have IoU scores lower than the threshold.\n",
    "    * `the image contains a bounding box of class i and model predicts no bounding box (IoU = 0.0) or bounding box for class i with low confidence (IoU < 0.5).`\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the extended definition above, we can now safely determine the _precision_ and _recall_ scores for our entire set of pairwise IoUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes in our dataset\n",
    "Note that in our bounding box dataset, we have two class labels `1` and `2`. We are provided a list of ground truth class labels, `gt_classes`, and a list of predicted class labels, `pred_classes`, as follows\n",
    "```\n",
    "gt_classes = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n",
    "pred_classes = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In our IoU scoring algorithm, we computed an `iou` score for each ground truth bounding box against the set of predicted boundng boxes in a row-column wise matrix, i.e., each `[row, col]` pair in our `ious` matrix corresponds to a ground truth-prediction bounding box pair. We can visualise this a bit easier below when turning the 2D matrix into a [pandas `DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revisiting the example in Fig. 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fig. 4 we have a single pair of bounding boxes with a resulting IoU score of $0.72$. Since this confidence value is above our threshold of $0.5$, we will count the bounding box prediction in our set of true positives."

While calculating mAP is not a requirement in this exercise, it is generally a good metric to observe in practice.

IoU serves an important role in _Non-Maxima Supression_, which is an algorithm to retain a single bounding box from a set of predictions with the greatest amount of overlap (in order to discard the rest). IoU can also be used as a loss metric or cost function in many deep learning applications."
